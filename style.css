    How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the external 
    CSS method (for this practice and moving forward). You should also try to use 
    several of the properties mentioned in the section above 
    
    color, 
    background color, 
    typography properties,
    
    Take some time to play around with the various 
    properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don’t worry at all about 
    making it look good. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to 
    make something to show off on your resume, so feel free to go a little crazy for 
    now.

    We haven’t covered how to use a custom font for the font-family property yet, so 
    for now take a look at CSS Fonts for a list of generic font families to use, and 
    CSS Web Safe Fonts for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that 
    these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be 
    sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
